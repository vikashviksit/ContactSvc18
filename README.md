# ContactSvc17

This is a source code of a production ready application designed and implemented for maintaining contact information. 
 
Functionality:  - add a contact - list contacts - edit contact - delete contact 
 
Contact model: - First Name - Last Name - Email - Phone Number - Status (Possible values: Active/Inactive) 

Project has been developed as an Web API MVC4 application with client as a SPA in Visual studio 2017. 

The project needs to build in V.S 2017 and can be run from the same for demonstarting the functionality.

The storage of records are done in the server memory cache avoid depedency on external storage for demostrating the Service and SPA.

The demonstration of database access layer would require project to be hosted and hence DAL module is not integrated.
